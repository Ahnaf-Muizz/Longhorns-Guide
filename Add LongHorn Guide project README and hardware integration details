# LongHorn Guide — HackTX 2025 ARM Track Winner 🏆  
### Intelligent Multilingual Campus Assistant

---

## 🎯 Inspiration
Starting college is exciting — but it can also be overwhelming.  
New students at UT Austin often struggle to find buildings, discover resources, or ask for help without hesitation.  

**LongHorn Guide** was created to solve that: a friendly, voice-first, AI-powered campus companion — available as a mobile app, chatbot, and even a physical robot escort — so every student can feel confident navigating campus life.

## 💡 What It Does
**LongHorn Guide** combines AI, automation, and robotics into a seamless experience:
- 🗣️ **Voice-First Agent** – Call anytime via an ElevenLabs mobile agent integrated with Twilio (multilingual support).  
- 💬 **Smart Chat Widget** – Ask natural-language questions through our Gemini-powered chat assistant.  
- 🧠 **Productivity Tools** – Manage schedules, send emails, and automate tasks using real-time n8n workflows.  
- 🤖 **Robot Escort** – Our autonomous Arduino-powered robot physically guides students to campus locations.

## 🧩 How We Built It
| Component | Tools / Tech |
|------------|-------------|
| **Frontend & Mobile** | React Native + Expo + CSS |
| **AI & Voice** | Google Gemini API + ElevenLabs + Twilio |
| **Automation** | n8n (local host + webhooks) |
| **Backend / Database** | Firebase (Realtime DB + Auth) |
| **Hardware** | Arduino Mega + Sensor Shield + Raspberry Pi 4 (ARM 64-bit) |

### 🧠 My Contribution — Arduino & Raspberry Pi Setup
- **Arduino Mega Configuration:**  
  - Wired and tested IR sensors and motors via the sensor shield.  
  - Programmed core movement logic in C++ for the autonomous robot escort.  

- **Raspberry Pi Integration:**  
  - Installed and configured Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) for ARM.  
  - Enabled SSH and I²C interfaces for hardware communication.  
  - Connected the Pi to the Arduino via serial communication (USB / UART).  
  - Set up Python environment to host the AI voice agent and bridge the hardware to the Gemini / ElevenLabs services.
